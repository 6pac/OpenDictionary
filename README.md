# OpenDictionary

Welcome to OpenDictionary, a modern, highly configurable and user friendly open source language management tool.

There's a lot going on at the moment, and the materials here are somewhat incomplete. This is a guide to where things are, and where things are up to.

## Materials

[Media Review](MediaReview.md) - what's out there, and how it looks. 

Once this is up to a basic standard we'll approach people for permission to put contact details up. 
You are welcome to contribute to the page.  
It's a lot better to submit proposed changes in writing (which makes them easy to apply), rather than make general suggestions.  
Since this is GitHub, the preferred method is to edit the page and it will submit a pull request with your changes. This can be rolled back or subsequently modified by the page maintainers.

## Activity

The OpenDictionary is actively being developed by Ben McIntyre (@6pac email.ben.mcintyre@gmail.com). 
Dr Ruth Singer at the University of Melbourne is using it to build a Kunbarlang and Mawng dictionary (Arnhem Land languages).
Dr Margaret Carew also used the tool at an earlier stage of development to build a Djinang/Wurlaki dictionary.

The road map at present is:
1) work on media review
1) rebuild project to integrate the two websites (public and admin) websites into one site, and refactor the UI library out so it can become a separate module
2) restructuring for Kunbarlang dictionary
3) add formatting and text-processing options so that configuration can be undertaken by the linguist instead of needing intervention by the developer
