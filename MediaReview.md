|  [SIL](#SIL)            |    [Toolbox](https://software.sil.org/toolbox/) |   Toolbox is the classic linguists's tool.  It is obsolete now, but many languages have been capured in its text-based file format. |
|  |    [Lexique Pro](http://lexiquepro.com/)    |  The update to toolbox, not also considered obsolete. Replaced by Flex. |
| | [Flex](https://software.sil.org/toolbox/)| Flex is the update to Toolbox. It is used to rapidly acquire works in a field situation, with the ability to store language details. |
| | [LanguageForge]https://languageforge.org/  | LanguageForge is a web based language editor that works on mobile and desktop devices, ideal for collaboration amongst groups. It will allow offline editing and can sync to Flex. |
| | [Webonary](https://www.webonary.org/)  |  Offers automated upload of language dictionary files to a very basic web dictionary. They have a page conparing them to other projects [here](https://www.webonary.org/comparisons/). LIFT XML is considered the new standard, and it [is recommended](https://www.webonary.org/about-webonary/) (under Data Formats Supported) to convert to this format for maximum cross-compatibility using [SOLID](https://www.webonary.org/about-webonary/) and Lexique Pro or preferably Flex.|
|  | [The LIFT Specification](https://github.com/sillsdev/lift-standard) | LIFT=Lexicon Markup Language. This link is strictly for  XML wonks. The PDF files give good exmples. |
