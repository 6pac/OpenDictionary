| Organisation       | Product    | Type | Notes |
| -------------           | -------------  | ---- | --------                       |
|  SIL           |   Summer Intitute of Linguistics (SIL) |  |  SIL have  nothing less than breathtaking [range of tools](https://software.sil.org/products/), and have produced all the major standard linguistic tools. Font/script support, audio cataloguing support, advice and support for language work, it's all there. See below for specific lexographic tools. |
| |    [Toolbox](https://software.sil.org/toolbox/) | Desktop (cross platform) |  Toolbox is the classic linguists's tool.  It is obsolete now, but many languages have been capured in its text-based file format. |
| |    [Lexique Pro](http://lexiquepro.com/)    |  Desktop (Windows only) | The update to toolbox, now also considered obsolete. Replaced by Flex. |
| | [Flex](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/) (Fieldworks Language Explorer) |  Desktop (Windows, experimental linux) | Flex is the most recent replacement for Toolbox and Lexique Pro. It is intended to rapidly acquire words in a field situation, with the ability to store language details. |
| | [LanguageForge](https://languageforge.org/)  | Web based + offline (any platform) |  LanguageForge is a web based language editor that works on mobile and desktop devices, ideal for collaboration amongst groups. It will allow offline editing and can sync to Flex. |
| | [Webonary](https://www.webonary.org/)  | Web result using desktop tools (Windows only) | Offers automated upload of language dictionary files to a very basic web dictionary. They have a page conparing them to other projects [here](https://www.webonary.org/comparisons/). LIFT XML is considered the new standard, and it [is recommended](https://www.webonary.org/about-webonary/) (under Data Formats Supported) to convert to this format for maximum cross-compatibility using [SOLID](https://www.webonary.org/about-webonary/) and Lexique Pro or preferably Flex.|
|  | [The LIFT Specification](https://github.com/sillsdev/lift-standard) | LIFT=Lexicon Markup Language. This link is strictly for  XML wonks. The PDF files give good exmples. |
| Stanford University  | [Kirrkirr](https://nlp.stanford.edu/kirrkirr/)   | Desktop (cross platform - Java) | Kirrkirr is quite sophisticated in its viewing, offering media viewing, word games, and a visual network diagram showing word relationships. It's quite old, developed in 2004, but v4.0.3 works fine on Windows after installing Java 11 from [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). Being Java based, it should be cross platform (Windows, OSX, Linux). In order to convert dictionaries to work with Kirrkirr, they need to be converted to XML format. The format is much more flexible than LIFT, but it is still not for the faint hearted. I would estimate several weeks of work at least, by someone not afraid to tackle the world of XML, to convert a reasonable sized dictionary. Then there is a further XML creation step necessary to render the dictionary data for the web. |
| Miromaa |  [Miromaa Software](https://www.miromaa.org.au/miromaa-software) Single user license $AU550, but looks like they can provide cheaply or free for endangered language work.  | Desktop (Windows only) | Miromaa advertise that they can create mobile apps and websites with their assistance, but it is not clear how automated this is or what the costs are. It appears that Miromaa uses a custom internal database format, but there is a Toolbox export facility. I have requested a license for academic evaluation of the software and of interoperability with other software. |
| Memrise |  [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/) | Web based tools | Commercial app for language learning. You can create your own course: https://memrise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360003072498-Course-Creation |
| TshwaneDJe |  [TLex Suite](https://tshwanedje.com/) (TLex+tlTerm+tlCorpus) Academic/Endangered license approx $AU350 | Desktop (cross platform) |  TshwaneDJe is commercial language software. It appears to be similar to Miromaa and KirrKirr in form. Export is only to database, text/scv and its own tshwanelexicon XML format. It doesn't appear that any Toolbox or LIFT compatibility exists. |
| Mother Tongues | [Mother Tongues](https://mothertongues.org/) | Mobile/Web | Provides an online and mobile dictionary from JSON files containing dictionary contents. Looks fairly straightforward and modern. Academic article around the issues being tackled [here](https://altlab.ualberta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CEL2_24.pdf), and open source language dictionary codebase [here](https://github.com/roedoejet/mothertongues). User interface is cross platform (Web/mobile) and built in Ionic. |
| ACORN (Dan Harvey) | [WOLF](http://acornslinguistics.com/) (Word Oriented Linguistic Framework) | Desktop (cross platform - Java) | Wolf is a desktop based software written in Java. The project looks a bit sketchy (there is a [Git repository](https://github.com/Acorns-Linguistics/Wolf) that is empty apart from the readme and license files. The program appears to be available from the author's personal pages [here](http://cs.sou.edu/~harveyd/wolf/index.php) and also [here](http://acornslinguistics.com/) under downloads, scroll down for WOLF). They say 'WOLF, though being freeware, is not yet open source. However, our intention is to make it so at some point after the software matures'. A very simple web dictionary export is available, example [here](http://acornslinguistics.com/). It appears that a similar PDF export is available. |
