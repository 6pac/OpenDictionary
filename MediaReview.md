| Organisation       | Product    | Notes |
| -------------           | -------------  | --------                       |
|  SIL           |   Summer Intitute of Linguistics (SIL) |   SIL have  nothing less than breathtaking [range of tools](https://software.sil.org/products/), and have produced all the major standard linguistic tools. Font/script support, audio cataloguing support, advice and support for language work, it's all there. See below for specific lexographic tools. |
| |    [Toolbox](https://software.sil.org/toolbox/) |   Toolbox is the classic linguists's tool.  It is obsolete now, but many languages have been capured in its text-based file format. |
| |    [Lexique Pro](http://lexiquepro.com/)    |  The update to toolbox, now also considered obsolete. Replaced by Flex. |
| | [Flex](https://software.sil.org/toolbox/)| Flex is the update to Toolbox. It is used to rapidly acquire works in a field situation, with the ability to store language details. |
| | [LanguageForge](https://languageforge.org/)  | LanguageForge is a web based language editor that works on mobile and desktop devices, ideal for collaboration amongst groups. It will allow offline editing and can sync to Flex. |
| | [Webonary](https://www.webonary.org/)  |  Offers automated upload of language dictionary files to a very basic web dictionary. They have a page conparing them to other projects [here](https://www.webonary.org/comparisons/). LIFT XML is considered the new standard, and it [is recommended](https://www.webonary.org/about-webonary/) (under Data Formats Supported) to convert to this format for maximum cross-compatibility using [SOLID](https://www.webonary.org/about-webonary/) and Lexique Pro or preferably Flex.|
|  | [The LIFT Specification](https://github.com/sillsdev/lift-standard) | LIFT=Lexicon Markup Language. This link is strictly for  XML wonks. The PDF files give good exmples. |
| Stanford University  | [Kirrkirr](https://nlp.stanford.edu/kirrkirr/)   | Kirrkirr is a desktop (*not* web based) dictonary tool, however is is quite sophisticated in its viewing, offering media viewing, word games, and a visual network diagram showing word relationships. It's quite old, developed in 2004, but v4.0.3 works fine on Windows after installing Java 11 from [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). Being Java based, it should be cross platform (Windows, OSX, Linux). In order to convert dictionaries to work with Kirrkirr, they need to be converted to XML format. The format is much more flexible than LIFT, but it is still not for the faint hearted. I would estimate several weeks of work at least, by someone not afraid to tackle the world of XML, to convert a reasonable sized dictionary. |
| Miromaa |  [Miromaa Software](https://www.miromaa.org.au/miromaa-software) | Miromaa is a desktop (*not* web based) dictonary tool, and runs only on Windows. They advertise that they can create mobile apps and websites with their assistance, but it is not clear how automated this is or what the costs are. It appears that Miromaa uses a custom internal database format, but there is a Toolbox export facility. Licences start at $AU550. I have requested a license for academic evaluation of the software and of interoperability with other software. |
| Memrise |  [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/) | Commercial app for language learning. You can create your own course: https://memrise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360003072498-Course-Creation |
| TshwaneDJe |  TLex Suite (TLex+tlTerm+tlCorpus) Academic/Endangered license approx $AU350 | TshwaneDJe is commercial language software. It runs on the desktop only, cross platform (Windows/OSX) and appears to be similar to Miromaa and KirrKirr in form. Export is only to database, text/scv and its own tshwanelexicon XML format. It doesn't appear that any Toolbox or LIFT compatibility exists. |
